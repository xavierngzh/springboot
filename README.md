# Spring Boot Tutorial Project

## Overview

This project is built using **Spring Boot**, a popular Java framework for creating web applications and microservices. The project was created by following a comprehensive YouTube tutorial, where I learned the basics of setting up a Spring Boot application, working with RESTful APIs, and integrating basic functionality like database access.

## What I've Learned

- **Setting up a Spring Boot Application**: I learned how to initialize a Spring Boot project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and integrate the necessary dependencies such as Spring Web and Spring Data JPA.

- **Building REST APIs**: The tutorial helped me understand how to create REST endpoints with Spring Boot using `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, and other related annotations.

- **Connecting to a Database**: I learned how to configure a database connection using Spring Data JPA and work with entities, repositories, and basic CRUD operations.

- **Handling Errors and Validation**: I now know how to implement global exception handling and input validation.

I want to give full credit to the creator of this tutorial for the clear explanations and step-by-step guidance. Without this tutorial, I wouldn't have been able to learn the essentials of Spring Boot development as effectively.
